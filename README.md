I am writing a backend for Php and a frontend for javascript. My frameworks are: laravel, vue, react. I am a fan of SOLID, I try to write code that will be easy to maintain in the future, I also understand and support the importance of tests. On this profile, github mainly projects from Udemy and YouTube courses. Private projects are hidden.
